# Secure Documentation System - Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Example Date)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for the "Secure Documentation System." The system will provide a platform for hosting company documentation built with MkDocs, with a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) layer to secure specific sections. It will also feature an administrative interface for managing users and permissions, and an in-browser content editing capability for authorized personnel.

### 1.2 Scope
The system will encompass:
*   A public-facing documentation site generated by MkDocs.
*   A Spring Boot backend for user authentication, RBAC, and serving secured content.
*   A PostgreSQL database for storing user, role, and permission data.
*   A React-based admin UI for managing the RBAC system.
*   Integration with Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) for in-browser Markdown content editing.
*   A CI/CD pipeline for automated building and deployment of the documentation site.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
*   **SDS:** Secure Documentation System
*   **MkDocs:** A static site generator for project documentation.
*   **RBAC:** Role-Based Access Control.
*   **Decap CMS:** (Formerly Netlify CMS) A Git-based headless CMS for static site generators.
*   **API:** Application Programming Interface.
*   **UI:** User Interface.
*   **JWT:** JSON Web Token.
*   **CI/CD:** Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment.
*   **Doc Resource:** A definable part of the documentation (e.g., a file, a folder, a pattern of paths) that can have permissions applied to it.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The SDS will be a central, secure repository for all company technical and procedural documentation. It will replace or augment existing documentation solutions, providing granular control over information access and a streamlined content update process.

### 2.2 Product Features
*   **Secure Content Delivery:** Serve MkDocs-generated documentation with section-level access control.
*   **User Authentication:** Allow users to register, log in, and log out.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Define roles and assign permissions to these roles for accessing specific documentation sections.
*   **RBAC Administration:** Provide a web UI for administrators to manage users, roles, permissions, and document resources.
*   **Access Request Workflow:** Allow users to request access to secured sections, with an admin approval process.
*   **In-Browser Content Editing:** Allow authorized content editors to modify documentation (Markdown files) via a Decap CMS interface.
*   **Dynamic Permission Granularity:** Support flexible permission assignment (e.g., access to all projects, specific sections within all projects, entire categories, specific files).
*   **Modern Look and Feel:** Documentation site themed similarly to modern documentation platforms (e.g., Netlify Docs).

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
*   **Unauthenticated Viewers:** Can access publicly available documentation sections (if any).
*   **Authenticated Viewers:** Can log in and access documentation sections based on their assigned roles and permissions.
*   **Content Editors:** Authorized personnel who can log into Decap CMS to create and modify documentation source files (Markdown). Authentication managed by Decap CMS backend (e.g., GitHub/GitLab).
*   **RBAC Administrators:** Users with access to the React admin UI to manage users, roles, doc resources, permissions, and access requests.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
*   **Client-Side:** Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **Server-Side:**
    *   Java environment for Spring Boot application.
    *   PostgreSQL database server.
    *   Web server/container for Spring Boot (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty).
    *   CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
*   **Content Source:** Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
*   The documentation site must be built using MkDocs.
*   The RBAC backend and API layer must be developed using Spring Boot.
*   The RBAC data must be stored in a PostgreSQL database.
*   The RBAC admin UI must be developed using React.
*   Content editing will be facilitated by Decap CMS.
*   The system must prioritize security in authentication, authorization, and data handling.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

#### 3.1.1 User Authentication & Management (Spring Boot & React Admin UI)
*   **FR1.1 User Registration:**
    *   Users shall be able to register for an account via a form on the MkDocs site (modal).
    *   Registration shall require username, email, and password.
    *   Upon successful registration, users may have default limited access or require admin approval for further access.
*   **FR1.2 User Login:**
    *   Users shall be able to log in via a form on the MkDocs site (modal) using their username/email and password.
    *   Successful login shall establish a session (e.g., via HTTPOnly cookie or JWT).
*   **FR1.3 User Logout:**
    *   Logged-in users shall be able to log out, terminating their session.
*   **FR1.4 User Profile (Basic):**
    *   (Optional) Users may be able to view/edit basic profile information.
*   **FR1.5 User Management (Admin UI):**
    *   RBAC Administrators shall be able to view a list of users.
    *   RBAC Administrators shall be able to activate/deactivate user accounts.
    *   RBAC Administrators shall be able to assign/unassign roles to users.

#### 3.1.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System (Spring Boot & React Admin UI)
*   **FR2.1 Role Management (Admin UI):**
    *   RBAC Administrators shall be able to create, read, update, and delete roles (e.g., "Project_A_Viewer", "Frontend_Team_Editor_Access").
    *   Each role shall have a unique name and an optional description.
*   **FR2.2 Document Resource Management (Admin UI):**
    *   RBAC Administrators shall be able to define "Doc Resources."
    *   Each Doc Resource shall have a unique `resource_identifier` (e.g., `/01-projects/*`, `/01-projects/project-a/overview.md`, `/02-frontend/*`) and a description.
    *   The `resource_identifier` will support path patterns (e.g., wildcards) for dynamic matching.
*   **FR2.3 Permission Definition (Admin UI & Backend):**
    *   The system shall support a "VIEW_DOCS" permission. (Future: "EDIT_DOCS" if integrating RBAC with Decap CMS deeply).
    *   RBAC Administrators shall be able to assign permissions on specific Doc Resources to roles.
*   **FR2.4 Granular Access Logic (Backend):**
    *   The backend must be able to resolve a user's access rights to a specific documentation path by:
        1.  Identifying the user's roles.
        2.  Finding all `doc_resource_id`s associated with those roles and the "VIEW_DOCS" permission.
        3.  Matching the requested documentation path against the `resource_identifier` patterns of these allowed resources.

#### 3.1.3 Secure Document Access & Serving (Spring Boot & MkDocs)
*   **FR3.1 Content Proxying:**
    *   The Spring Boot application shall act as a reverse proxy for the statically generated MkDocs site.
*   **FR3.2 Access Enforcement:**
    *   Before serving any documentation page (HTML file from MkDocs `site` directory), the Spring Boot application shall:
        1.  Verify the user's authentication status.
        2.  Check if the authenticated user (via their roles) has "VIEW_DOCS" permission for the requested document path based on the RBAC rules.
    *   If authorized, the content shall be served.
    *   If not authorized, an appropriate error (e.g., 403 Forbidden or redirect to login) shall be returned.
*   **FR3.3 Public Access:**
    *   Specific Doc Resources can be marked or configured to be publicly accessible without authentication.
*   **FR3.4 Decap CMS Admin Path:**
    *   Paths under `/admin/` (for Decap CMS) shall be served without the Spring Boot RBAC view-permission checks, as Decap CMS handles its own authentication.

#### 3.1.4 Documentation Presentation (MkDocs)
*   **FR4.1 MkDocs Site Structure:**
    *   The documentation will follow the directory structure defined by the user (e.g., `/docs/00-introduction/`, `/docs/01-projects/`, etc.).
*   **FR4.2 Theming:**
    *   The MkDocs site shall use the `mkdocs-material` theme.
    *   The theme shall be customized to resemble the look and feel of modern documentation sites (e.g., Netlify Docs), including:
        *   Custom logo and favicon.
        *   Light/Dark mode toggle.
        *   Custom header with "Login", "Sign up" buttons/modals, and user status display (e.g., "Welcome, [username]", "Logout").
        *   Customizable footer.
*   **FR4.3 Navigation:**
    *   The primary navigation shall be generated by MkDocs from the `nav` configuration.
    *   **UX Consideration:** For paths a user cannot access, the navigation link might still be visible. Clicking it will result in an access denied message from the backend. (Future Enhancement: Client-side JavaScript to hide inaccessible nav links based on an API call).
*   **FR4.4 Search:**
    *   The MkDocs Material search plugin will be enabled.
    *   **Security Consideration:** The default MkDocs search index (`search_index.json`) contains all content. This means users might see snippets of restricted content in search results. (Mitigation: Disable search, implement custom permission-aware search, or client-side filtering of search results â€“ these are complex enhancements). For v1, the risk of information leakage via search snippets for restricted pages must be acknowledged if default search is used without modification.

#### 3.1.5 Content Editing (Decap CMS)
*   **FR5.1 Decap CMS Integration:**
    *   The system shall integrate Decap CMS for in-browser editing of Markdown content files.
    *   An `/admin/` path shall serve the Decap CMS interface.
*   **FR5.2 Decap CMS Configuration (`admin/config.yml`):**
    *   The `config.yml` shall define collections mapping to the MkDocs documentation structure.
    *   It shall configure a Git backend (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) for content storage and versioning.
    *   Authentication for Decap CMS will be handled by the configured backend (e.g., users log in with their GitHub/GitLab accounts).
*   **FR5.3 Content Workflow:**
    *   Authorized Content Editors shall be able to log in to Decap CMS.
    *   Editors shall be able to create, edit, and save Markdown files corresponding to the documentation structure.
    *   Saving changes in Decap CMS shall commit the changes to the configured Git repository and branch.
*   **FR5.4 Media Management:**
    *   Decap CMS shall support uploading and managing media assets (images, etc.), storing them in a configured path within the Git repository (e.g., `docs/assets/images/`).

#### 3.1.6 Access Request Workflow (Spring Boot & React Admin UI)
*   **FR6.1 Request Submission:**
    *   Authenticated users shall be able to submit requests for access to specific Doc Resources or pre-defined roles.
    *   The request shall include a justification.
*   **FR6.2 Request Management (Admin UI):**
    *   RBAC Administrators shall be able to view pending access requests.
    *   RBAC Administrators shall be able to approve or reject requests.
    *   Approval may automatically assign the requested role or permissions to the user.
    *   Admins shall be able to add notes to the request processing.

#### 3.1.7 CI/CD Pipeline
*   **FR7.1 Automated Build:**
    *   A CI/CD pipeline shall be triggered upon commits to the main documentation branch in the Git repository (where Decap CMS commits changes).
*   **FR7.2 MkDocs Build:**
    *   The pipeline shall install MkDocs, themes, and plugins.
    *   The pipeline shall execute `mkdocs build` to generate the static `site` directory.
*   **FR7.3 Deployment:**
    *   The pipeline shall deploy the generated `site` directory to the location from which the Spring Boot application serves the documentation.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
*   **NFR1 Security:**
    *   All authentication and authorization mechanisms must be secure.
    *   Passwords must be stored securely (hashed and salted).
    *   Sensitive data in transit must be encrypted (HTTPS).
    *   The system must be protected against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection).
    *   RBAC rules must be strictly enforced.
*   **NFR2 Performance:**
    *   Documentation pages should load quickly for users.
    *   The Admin UI and Decap CMS interface should be responsive.
    *   API responses from the Spring Boot backend should be timely.
*   **NFR3 Usability:**
    *   The documentation site should be easy to navigate.
    *   The RBAC Admin UI should be intuitive for administrators.
    *   The Decap CMS editing experience should be straightforward for content editors.
*   **NFR4 Scalability:**
    *   The system should be able to handle a growing number of documentation pages, users, and roles without significant degradation in performance.
*   **NFR5 Maintainability:**
    *   The codebase for Spring Boot and React applications should be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain.
    *   Configuration for MkDocs and Decap CMS should be clear and manageable.
*   **NFR6 Reliability:**
    *   The system should have high availability, ensuring documentation is accessible when needed.

## 5. System Architecture Overview

### 5.1 High-Level Architecture
The Secure Documentation System (SDS) will employ a multi-component architecture:

![High-Level Architecture Diagram Placeholder - A diagram would typically go here showing the user, browser, Spring Boot App, MkDocs build, Decap CMS, Git Repo, CI/CD, and Database interactions.]

*   **User Interaction Layer:**
    *   **Documentation Site (MkDocs + Customizations):** Served to end-users. Login/Signup modals interact with the Backend API.
    *   **RBAC Admin UI (React):** For administrators to manage the system. Interacts with the Backend API.
    *   **Decap CMS UI:** For content editors. Interacts directly with the configured Git backend (e.g., GitHub API) for content operations and its own authentication.
*   **Application & Logic Layer (Spring Boot):**
    *   **API Endpoints:** Exposes RESTful APIs for authentication, RBAC management, access requests, and potentially user-specific data.
    *   **RBAC Engine:** Core logic for evaluating user permissions against requested document resources.
    *   **Content Serving Proxy:** Intercepts requests for MkDocs content, performs RBAC checks, and serves static files if authorized.
    *   **Decap CMS Admin File Server:** Serves the `/admin/` directory for Decap CMS.
*   **Data Layer (PostgreSQL):**
    *   Stores all user accounts, roles, document resource definitions, permission mappings, and access requests.
*   **Content Source & Build Layer:**
    *   **Git Repository (e.g., GitHub/GitLab):** Single source of truth for Markdown documentation content.
    *   **Decap CMS:** Client-side application that pushes changes to the Git repository.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automates the `mkdocs build` process upon changes in the Git repository and deploys the static `site` output.
    *   **MkDocs Build Output (`site` directory):** Contains the generated static HTML, CSS, JS, and the Decap CMS `admin` folder, ready to be served by the Spring Boot application.

### 5.2 Component Breakdown

#### 5.2.1 MkDocs Static Site
*   **Responsibility:** Renders Markdown content into a navigable HTML website.
*   **Technology:** MkDocs, MkDocs Material theme, various Markdown extensions.
*   **Interaction:** Its output (`site` directory) is served by the Spring Boot application. Contains client-side JavaScript for login/signup modals and potentially for UI enhancements related to permissions (e.g., hiding nav links).

#### 5.2.2 Spring Boot Backend
*   **Responsibility:**
    *   User authentication and session management.
    *   Authorization based on RBAC rules.
    *   Serving static MkDocs content (with RBAC enforcement).
    *   Providing APIs for the React Admin UI and MkDocs site's auth modals.
    *   Managing access requests.
*   **Technology:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA.
*   **Interaction:** Communicates with PostgreSQL for data persistence, serves content to user browsers, and provides APIs to frontend components.

#### 5.2.3 PostgreSQL Database
*   **Responsibility:** Persistent storage of all RBAC-related data, user accounts, and access requests.
*   **Technology:** PostgreSQL.
*   **Interaction:** Accessed by the Spring Boot backend via JDBC/JPA.

#### 5.2.4 React Admin UI
*   **Responsibility:** Provides an interface for RBAC administrators to manage the system.
*   **Technology:** React, JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS.
*   **Interaction:** Consumes REST APIs exposed by the Spring Boot backend.

#### 5.2.5 Decap CMS
*   **Responsibility:** Provides an in-browser editing interface for Markdown content.
*   **Technology:** React (as a pre-built application), configured via `admin/config.yml`.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   Its `admin/index.html` and `admin/config.yml` are served by the Spring Boot application (via the MkDocs build output).
    *   Authenticates users and interacts directly with the configured Git provider's API (e.g., GitHub API) to read/write Markdown files and media.

#### 5.2.6 CI/CD Pipeline
*   **Responsibility:** Automates the build and deployment of the MkDocs site.
*   **Technology:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.
*   **Interaction:** Monitors the Git repository, runs `mkdocs build`, and deploys the `site` directory.

### 5.3 Data Flow Examples

#### 5.3.1 User Viewing a Secured Document:
1.  User browser requests `https://docs.yourcompany.com/01-projects/project-a/architecture.html`.
2.  Spring Boot app intercepts the request.
3.  Spring Boot checks user's session/JWT for authentication.
4.  If authenticated, Spring Boot queries PostgreSQL (via RBAC Engine) to check if the user's roles grant "VIEW_DOCS" permission for the `resource_identifier` matching `/01-projects/project-a/architecture.html`.
5.  If authorized, Spring Boot reads `site/01-projects/project-a/architecture.html` and serves it.
6.  If not authenticated or not authorized, Spring Boot returns a 401/403 error or redirects to login.

#### 5.3.2 Admin Assigning a Role to a User:
1.  Admin logs into the React Admin UI.
2.  Admin navigates to user management and selects a user and a role to assign.
3.  React Admin UI sends a `POST` or `PUT` request to `/api/admin/users/{userId}/roles` (or similar) with the role ID.
4.  Spring Boot API endpoint receives the request, validates admin privileges.
5.  Spring Boot updates the `user_roles` table in PostgreSQL.
6.  Spring Boot returns a success response to the React Admin UI.

#### 5.3.3 Content Editor Saving a Document:
1.  Editor logs into Decap CMS at `https://docs.yourcompany.com/admin/`. Decap CMS authenticates them against the configured Git provider (e.g., GitHub).
2.  Editor makes changes to a document and clicks "Save" (or "Publish").
3.  Decap CMS (client-side) uses the Git provider's API to commit the changes to the specified branch in the Git repository.
4.  The commit triggers the CI/CD pipeline.
5.  CI/CD pipeline checks out the code, runs `mkdocs build`, and deploys the updated `site` directory.
6.  The next time a user views the document (and is authorized), they see the updated content.

## 6. Assumptions and Dependencies

### 6.1 Assumptions
*   A Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or similar) will be available for storing documentation source and for Decap CMS integration.
*   A CI/CD platform is available and can be configured to build and deploy MkDocs sites.
*   The hosting environment can support a Java Spring Boot application and a PostgreSQL database.
*   Users (viewers, editors, admins) will have access to modern web browsers.
*   The initial content structure and Markdown files will be provided or migrated.
*   RBAC administrators will be technically proficient enough to define `resource_identifier` patterns.

### 6.2 Dependencies
