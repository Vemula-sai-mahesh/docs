# Terminology Glossary

This glossary defines common terms used throughout this documentation and in discussions related to our services and technologies.

*   **Full Stack Development:**
    *   An approach to software development where developers are proficient in both front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) technologies, capable of overseeing a project from conception to completion.

*   **Java:**
    *   A versatile, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence and robustness, extensively used for enterprise-scale applications.

*   **Spring Boot:**
    *   An open-source, Java-based framework that simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications and microservices with minimal configuration.

*   **React:**
    *   A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It is known for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering.

*   **Angular:**
    *   A comprehensive, TypeScript-based web application framework developed by Google, suitable for building complex web, mobile, and desktop applications.

*   **Node.js:**
    *   A JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling server-side JavaScript execution. It is often used for building fast, scalable network applications and APIs.

*   **Microservices Architecture:**
    *   An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is self-contained and focuses on a specific business capability.

*   **API (Application Programming Interface):**
    *   A contract that allows different software components or systems to communicate and exchange data.
    *   **REST APIs (Representational State Transfer APIs):** An architectural style for designing networked applications, commonly using HTTP methods for data manipulation.
    *   **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs and a server-side runtime for fulfilling those queries with existing data.

*   **Docker:**
    *   A platform that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers bundle an application's code with all its dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments.

*   **Kubernetes (K8s):**
    *   An open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

*   **AWS (Amazon Web Services):**
    *   A leading cloud computing platform offering a vast array of services, including compute power, storage solutions, databases, and machine learning tools.

*   **Azure:**
    *   Microsoft's cloud computing platform, providing a comprehensive suite of services for building, deploying, and managing applications.

*   **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery/Deployment):**
    *   A methodology and set of practices that automate the software development lifecycle, enabling frequent, reliable, and efficient releases.

*   **Git:**
    *   A distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

*   **Agile/Scrum:**
    *   **Agile:** An iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery of value.
    *   **Scrum:** A specific Agile framework for managing complex product development, characterized by fixed-length iterations (Sprints) and defined roles.
