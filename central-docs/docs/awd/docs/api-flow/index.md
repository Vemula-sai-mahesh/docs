# API Flow

This section describes the API flows for the AWD system.

## Overview

The AWD system exposes a set of APIs to manage [briefly describe the purpose of the AWD system, e.g., agricultural data, farmer information, etc.].  This document outlines the key workflows involved in interacting with these APIs.

## Key API Flows

Here's a summary of the main API flows:

* **Farmer Management:**
    * [Link to a more detailed document, if you have one, e.g.,](farmer-registration.md) Farmer Registration:  Describes the process of creating and managing farmer accounts.
    * [Link to a more detailed document, if you have one, e.g.,](farmer-update.md) Farmer Profile Update: Explains how to modify farmer information.
* **Plot Management:**
    * [Link to a more detailed document, if you have one, e.g.,](plot-creation.md) Plot Creation: Details the steps involved in registering new agricultural plots.
    * [Link to a more detailed document, if you have one, e.g.,](plot-mapping.md) Plot Ownership Mapping: Describes how to assign ownership of plots to farmers.
* **Data Retrieval:**
    * [Link to a more detailed document, if you have one, e.g.,](farmer-plots.md)  Retrieving Farmer's Plots: Explains how to get a list of plots associated with a specific farmer.

## Authentication

[Describe how the APIs are authenticated (e.g., using API keys, OAuth 2.0, etc.).  This is crucial!]

## Error Handling

[Explain the general error response format and common error codes.]
